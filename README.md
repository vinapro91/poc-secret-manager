# Secret Manager Implementation with NestJS

This project demonstrates the implementation of Google Secret Manager using the NestJS framework. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage secrets such as API keys, database credentials, and other sensitive information in a secure manner. The goal is to show how to integrate Google Secret Manager into a NestJS application to enhance the security and management of sensitive data.

## Features

- Google Secret Manager Integration: Securely stores and accesses secrets using Google Cloud's Secret Manager.
- Environment-Based Secrets: Manages secrets based on different environments (e.g., development, production).
- Automatic Secret Retrieval: Fetches secrets dynamically during application runtime.
- Best Practices: Implements security best practices for managing sensitive information.

# Getting Started

Prerequisites
Node.js v14+ and npm
NestJS CLI
Google Cloud Account with Secret Manager API enabled

## Installation

Clone the repository:

bash

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vinapro91/poc-secret-manager.git
cd secret-manager-nestjs
```
